This is an intelligent stock market analysis application that leverages LSTM neural networks for price prediction and trend analysis. The project features an interactive Streamlit interface with real-time visualizations, candlestick charts, and AI-powered predictions for major tech stocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* At least 4GB RAM (for model training)
* Internet connection (for fetching stock data)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NBGamer99/stock-market-lstm-prediction.git
   ```

2. It is recommended to use a virtual environment
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download pre-trained models (optional)
   ```sh
   # Models will be automatically trained on first run if not present
   # Pre-trained models can be found in the /models directory
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command in the project directory:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

### Supported Stocks
The application currently supports analysis for:
- AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- ADBE (Adobe Inc.)
- AMZN (Amazon.com Inc.)
